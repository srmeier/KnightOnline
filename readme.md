# Open Knight Online (OpenKO)

<p align="left">
I started with project to learn more about how the MMORPG Knight Online works. MMORPGs are very intricate programs requiring knowledge in many areas of computer science such as TCP/IP, SQL server, performance tuning, 3D graphics and animation, load balancing, and more. Starting with the original leaked source I have updated to DirectX 9, wrapped window creation and player input using SDL 2.0, added function flags so that various file formats may be supported while remaining backwards compatible, and much more.
